**Technical summary report of the New Zealand Environmental Integrated Data Infrastructure Proof of Concept**

The environmental Integrated Data Infrastructure (**e-IDI**) aims to make environmental data more discoverable, shareable and accessible to support the supply and usage of authentic product data provided by local and central government agencies using a solution on the Web.  The Proof of Concept (**PoC**) sought to test a basic architecture proposal for the system that would support this goal.

The architecture was devised to leverage existing infrastructure and meet key additional criteria identified by the NRS working group.  The PoC participants were  identified for their use of different systems each component of the architecture. Finally, the system was tested using real data and a commercial solution that utilised web and data best practice.

The PoC enabled a working system to be developed.  The system functioned correctly with appropriate response times.  The learnings from the PoC are an opportunity to build the future foundations for a national infrastructure. There will be several developments continuing on from this work.
